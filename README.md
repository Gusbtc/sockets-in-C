# TCP Client & Server in C

This repository contains a basic implementation of a **TCP client and server** written in **C**, created purely for learning and practice purposes.

## 🧠 Purpose

The goal of this project is to practice working with **TCP socket programming**, understand the flow of communication between client and server, and reinforce concepts like structs, pointers, and input/output handling in C.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `clientTCP.c` — Source code for the TCP client.
- `serverTCP.c` — Source code for the TCP server.
